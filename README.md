# rajSVD
Given few set of images, this project intelligently generates entirely new possible images using  [Reduced Singular Value Decomposition(SVD)](https://github.com/ljtamang/rajSVD/blob/master/reduced_SVD_slide.pdf).  The code implementation is in matlab.

## Practical use case
**Input:** Hey software, last night a robbery has occurred at Store A. Luckily we have image of person from video surveillance and unfortunately he has mask on face. In morning, we have a suspect in our custody and here is his image. Can you please verify whether this suspect one wearing mask in surveillance system?

**Output:** (yes/no)

## Approach
For the purpose of simplicity, I will just use 3 images and gray scale images.

  1.	Given image I1, I2 and I3, create data matrix A where each column of represents single image data.
  2.	Apply reduced singular value decomposition(SVD) to obtain basis U that spans the data of image.
  3.	Randomly generate coefficients c1, c2 and c3. Create new linear combination L = c1 * m1 + c2 * u2 + c3 * u3, where u1,         u2 and u3 are column of U. The L is the new image data.
  4.	You can create any number of possible images by repeating process 3.

Ths project is name rajSVD to reconize by eldest brother Raj Kumar Lama who supported me in all possible for my study and SVD algorithm which is heart of this implementaion. I would also acknowledge [Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian](https://www.computationalocularscience.com/members/), The University of memphis, who made me this algorithm crystal clear.
